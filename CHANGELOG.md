#
- Add `DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteracitve` when doing a DEB build so that when `tzdata` is installed as dependency it won't stop a build
- Don't use `setarch` when arch is all/noarch
- Make Ctrl-C cancellation instantaneous, no more waiting for the jobs to finish
- Use Rocky Linux for simple RPM builds
- Add alpine APK target [#75](https://github.com/vv9k/pkger/pull/75)

# 0.6.0
- Use default OS config directory instead of home directory to read the configuration file by default.
- Add `init` subcommand that creates necessary directories and adds a configuration file.
- Add `edit` subcommand that invokes `$EDITOR` and lets users easily edit recipes and images with the default editor.
- Remove `gen-recipe` subcommand and add `new <recipe|image>` subcommand that creates the directories for the new recipes
  and images as well as the files inside.
- Add ability to specify the same set of dependencies for multiple images at once by joining the names with the `+` sign
  like this: `image1+image2+image3: [ package1, package2 ]`
- Add `--raw` flag to `list` subcommand to disable colored output.
- Add `--verbose` flag to `list` subcommand to display additional fields.
- When building a `rpm` package a `src.rpm` will be downloaded as well.


# 0.5.0
- If at least one task fails to build **pkger** will now return with exit code 1 [#66](https://github.com/vv9k/pkger/pull/66)
- `--quiet` flag now suppresses only container output, normal info output is still available [#67](https://github.com/vv9k/pkger/pull/67)
- `pkger build` will now display a warning with instructions on how to start a build [#68](https://github.com/vv9k/pkger/pull/68)
- Use appropriate cache dir on each OS to store images state [#71](https://github.com/vv9k/pkger/pull/71)
- Automatically calculate `Installed-Size` when building DEB packages [#72](https://github.com/vv9k/pkger/pull/72)
- Users can now specify `filter` in the configuration so that if one wants to format the output in a particular way on
  each build they don't have to pass the `--filter` CLI parameter every time.
- Fix a typo in deb field - `enchances` -> `enhances`  
- Images are now be defined in the global configuration file. Previously users would have to define an image with a
  target or os on each recipe, now recipe only requires the image name , and the definition is in the configuration.
  WARNING! this makes old state files not compatible and requires manual deletion of `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/pkger.state` file.
  [#73](https://github.com/vv9k/pkger/pull/73)
- Add `list packages` subcommand that lists built packages from output directory.
- Add `clean-cache` subcommand that deletes the cached state from OS. Use this to migrate **pkger** to the newest version.
- Improved error messages during initialization now contain full context of how the error originated.
- Save image state only when it changed.
- Automatically convert `_` to `-` when building a DEB. Debian packages don't allow underscores in package names.
- Add `all_images` field to recipe metadata so that if a recipe is used with all images they don't have to be listed
  one by one.
- Add a warning when image specified as cli arg is not found in recipe image targets.
- Add support for extracting all types of tar archives as source.
- Fix rpm build not working when packaging files with spaces.
- Add an option to set `AutoReqProv` value during RPM build (used to disable automatic dependency processing).
- Add `RECIPE`, `RECIPE_VERSION`, `RECIPE_RELEASE` environment variables that can be used during the build.
- Enable usage of environment variables for `working_dir` and `source` fields of recipe. This can greatly reduce
  the number of changes one has to make when adding a recipe for other version. [#74](https://github.com/vv9k/pkger/pull/74)

# 0.4.0
- Add an option to sign RPMs with a GPG key [#55](https://github.com/vv9k/pkger/pull/55)

- Fix image caching
- Add `forward_ssh_agent` configuration option to forward the SSH authentication socket from the host machine to 
  the container. [#58](https://github.com/vv9k/pkger/pull/58)
- Add `--no-sign` command line argument to `build` command so that users can disable signing for the particular build
  even when the gpg signing is enabled in the configuration.
- Move `forward_ssh_agent` option to `ssh` configuration and rename it to `forward_agent` [#60](https://github.com/vv9k/pkger/pull/60)

- Add ability to apply patches to source based on target image
- Directory structure of `output_dir` changed, now all images have a separate directory with output packages
- Fix ubuntu builds
- Add `list < recipes | images >` subcommand

# 0.2.1
- Fix setting default working directory in build and install phase

# 0.2.0

- Actually check if image should be rebuilt in docker [#37](https://github.com/vv9k/pkger/pull/37)
- Cache images with dependencies installed, a lot of data saved on pulled dependencies [#38](https://github.com/vv9k/pkger/pull/38)
- Dependencies now use the TOML syntax instead of a custom one [#39](https://github.com/vv9k/pkger/pull/39)
- Commands in configure, build and install scripts now use TOML syntax [#40](https://github.com/vv9k/pkger/pull/40)
- Add `--trace` option that sets log level of pkger to trace and make `--debug` actually set debug
- Add some more fields for RPM builds, rename `section` to `group` and use it for RPM as well as DEB [#41](https://github.com/vv9k/pkger/pull/41)
- Separate RPM and DEB fields in recipe metadata [#42](https://github.com/vv9k/pkger/pull/42)
- Add missing fields for DEB builds, add `url` field to metadata [#43](https://github.com/vv9k/pkger/pull/43)
