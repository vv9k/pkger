# Metadata (Required)

Contains all fields that describe the package being built.

## required fields

```yaml
metadata:
  name: pkger
  description: pkger
  license: MIT
  version: 0.1.0
```

## optional fields

To specify which images a recipe should use add images parameter with a list of image targets. This field is ignored when building with `--simple` flag.

```yaml
  images:
    - name: centos8
      target: rpm
    - name: debian10
      target: deb
    - name: arch
      target: pkg
```

### sources

This fields are responsible for fetching the files used for the build. When both `git` and `source` are specified **pkger** will fetch both to the build directory.

If `source` starts with a prefix like `http` or `https` the file that if points to will be downloaded. If the file is an archive like `.tar.gz` or `.tar.xz` or `.zip` it will be directly extracted to [`$PKGER_BLD_DIR`](./env.md#pkger-variables), otherwise the file will be copied to the directory untouched.

```yaml
  source: "" # remote source or file system location

  git: https://github.com/wojciechkepka/pkger.git # will default to branch = "master"

  # or specify a branch like this:
  git:
    url: https://github.com/wojciechkepka/pkger.git
    branch: dev
```


### common

Optional fields shared across all targets.

```yaml
  release: "1" # defaults to "0"

  epoch: "42"

  maintainer: "Wojciech KÄ™pka <wojciech@wkepka.dev>"

# The website of the package being built
  url: https://github.com/wojciechkepka/pkger

  arch: x86_64 # defaults to `noarch` on RPM and `all` on DEB, `x86_64` automatically converted to `amd64` on DEB...

  skip_default_deps: true # skip installing default dependencies, it might break the builds

  exclude: ["share", "info"] # directories to exclude from final package

  group: "" # acts as Group in RPM or Section in DEB build
```


### dependencies

Common fields that specify dependencies, conflicts and provides will be added to the spec of the final package. 

This fields can be specified as arrays:
```yaml
  depends: []
  conflicts: []
  provides: []
```
Or specified per image as a map below.

**pkger** will install all dependencies listed in `build_depends`, choosing an appropriate package manager for each supported distribution. Default dependencies like `gzip` or `git` might be installed depending on the target job type.

```yaml
  build_depends:
    # common dependencies shared across all images
    all: ["gcc", "pkg-config", "git"]

    # dependencies for custom images
    centos8: ["cargo", "openssl-devel"]
    debian10: ["curl", "libssl-dev"]
```

if running a simple build and there is a need to specify dependencies for the target add dependencies for one of this images:

```yaml
  pkger-rpm: ["cargo"]
  pkger-deb: ["curl"]
  pkger-pkg: ["cargo"]
  pkger-gzip: []
```
