    # to be included in the final pkg
    install: ".install"
    
    # A list of files to be backed up when package will be removed or upgraded
    backup: ["/etc/pkger.conf"]
    
    # A list of packages that this package replaces
    replaces: []
    
    # This are dependencies that this package needs to offer full functionality.
