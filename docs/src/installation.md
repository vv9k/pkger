# Installation

If you're using Arch Linux you can get **pkger** from *AUR* repositories with your favourite package manager like so:
 - `paru pkger-rs`

On other Linux distributions or MacOS download one of the latest prebuild static binaries from [here](https://github.com/wojciechkepka/pkger/releases). If your desired target is not on the list you'll have to build **pkger** from source by cloning the repository from `https://github.com/wojciechkepka/pkger` and building it with:
 - `cargo build --release`
